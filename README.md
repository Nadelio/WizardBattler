Something stupid I am doing, not really any purpose to this other than to practice advanced Java programming

# 
Current Features:
- Player, Enemy, and Entity classes
- Level 1 Actions
- Level 2 Actions
- Misc Databases
- Fighting
- Leveling Up
# 
Current Bugs/Dependecy Errors:
- Finish implementing all events
- Add NPC class
  - Add shops, items, etc.
- Rebuild `Action` class to implement `Runnable` and then initiate a Cyclic Barrier that updates every turn to match the number of active Action threads, start the Action threads at the same time
- Add encounters (aka NPC encounter, fight encounter, discover item, etc)
- JButtons, JFrame, JLabel, Menu system, etc.
